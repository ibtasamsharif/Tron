# Tron

Tron Disc is one of the most famous programmable artifact in both the game grid and the Tron system. Tron disc is also known as the identity disc and is in the form of a detachable glowing disc worn on the upper back. As part of the class project, my team decided to create a new version of the disc with multiple modes which are represented by different glowing colors along with the charging station for the Tron enthusiasts.
