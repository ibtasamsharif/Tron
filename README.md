# Tron

Tron Disc is one of the most famous programmable artifact in both the game grid and the Tron system. Tron disc is also known as the identity disc and is in the form of a detachable glowing disc worn on the upper back. As part of the class project, my team decided to create a new version of the disc with multiple modes which are represented by different glowing colors along with the charging station for the Tron enthusiasts. 

1.	Tron disc is using 4 pins
•	Digital Pin 2 is connected to the switch button
•	Digital Pin 4 is connected to LED strip
•	Digital Pin 5 is the Input Pin. It acts as a waiting receiver
•	Digital Pin 7 is the output pin. This pin acts as the continuous sender of HIGH signal

2.	Tron base uses 2 pins
•	Digital Pin 5 is and Input pin.
•	Digital Pin 7 is the output pin and is always in HIGH state

3.	The Input pins on both the disc and the charging station are waiting for input from each other. When the disc receives the input at Pin5 , it puts the disc in the charging state.
